1.  Introduction

   INTRODCUTION

2.  TLS Visibility Extension

   This section specifies the "tls_visibility" extension, which is
   carried in the ClienHello message and the ServerHello message.

   The general extension mechanisms enable clients and servers to
   negotiate the use of specific extensions.  As specified in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], clients request extended functionality from
   servers with the extensions field in the ClienHello message.  If the
   server responds HelloRetryRequest, then the client sends another
   ClientHello message that includes the same extensions field as the
   original ClienHello message.

   Most server extensions are carried in the EncryptedExtensions
   message; however, the "tls_visibility" extension is carried in the
   ServerHello message in a manner similar to the "key_share" and
   "pre_shared_key" extensions.  It is only present in the ServerHello
   message if the server wants to enable TLS Visibility for some other
   parties and the client has offered the "tls_visibility" extension in
   the ClientHello message.

   The "tls_visibility" extension MUST NOT appear in the ServerHello
   message unless "tls_visibility" extension appeared in the preceding
   ClientHello message.  The Figure 2 provides an additional row for the
   table in Section 4.2 of [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  It indicates that the
   "tls_visibility" extension may appear in the CH (ClientHello message)
   and SH (ServerHello message), and it MUST NOT appear in any other
   messages.  If an implementation recognizes the "tls_visibility"
   extension and receives it in any other message, then the
   implementation MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter"
   alert.

   repeated here for convenience.

       struct {
           ExtensionType extension_type;
           opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
       } Extension;


   The "extension_type" identifies the particular extension type, and
   the "extension_data" contains information specific to the particular
   extension type.

   This document specifies the "tls_visibility" extension type, adding
   one new type to ExtensionType:

       enum {
           tls_visibility(TBD), (65535)
       } ExtensionType;


   The "tls_visibility" extension is relevant when the client and server
   are enabling other parties to decrypt the TLS session.

   Clients MUST include the "tls_visibility" extension in the
   ClientHello message to indicate their willingness for other parties
   to decrypt the TLS session.  The server responds with data that
   enables the other parties to derive the keying material needed
   decryption the session if they are in possession of the indicated
   ECDH private key.

     struct {
         select (Handshake.msg_type) {
             case client_hello:  Empty;
             case server_hello:  WrappedSessionSecrets visibility_data;
         };
     } TLSVisibilityExtension;

     struct {
         opaque early_secret<1..255>;
         opaque hs_secret<1..255>;
     } SessionSecrets;

     struct {
         opaque fingerprint<20>;
         opaque key_exchange<1..2^16-1>;
         opaque nonce<0..255>;
         opaque wrapped_secrets<1..2^16-1>;
     } WrappedSessionSecrets;

   The fields in WrappedSessionSecrets are used as follows:

   o  "fingerprint" contains the leftmost 20 octets of the SHA-256 hash
      of ECDH public key that was used by the server to compute the
      session secret wrapping key.  The public key is DER-encoded in the
      SubjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280] for the SHA-256 hash computation.
      The key manager tells the server which AEAD algorithm to use with
      this ECDH public key at the time it is distributed.

   o  "key_exchange" contains the ephemeral ECDH public key generated by
      the server that is part of the same group as the ECDH public key
      identified by the "fingerprint".  The server uses the ephemeral
      ECDH private key and the ECDH public key identified by the
      "fingerprint" to compute a shared secret value, called Z, and then
      uses HKDF [RFC5869] to produce the session secret wrapping key,
      called Ke, which uses an AEAD algorithm, such as AES-KEY-WRAP-256
      [RFC5649] or AES-GCM-128 [GCM].  Ke is computed as follows:

              PRK = HKDF-Extract(0x00, Z)
              Ke = HKDF-Expand(PRK, "tls_visibility", AEAD_key_size)


   o  "nonce" contains the nonce value for AEAD algorithm, if one is
      needed.  The "nonce" is zero length if one is not needed.

   o  "wrapped_secrets" contains the SessionSecrets structure encrypted
      with the AEAD algorithm under Ke.

   The fields in SessionSecrets are used as follows:

   o  "early_secret" contains the Early Secret that was derived from the
      pre-shared key.  If this session did not use a pre-shared key,
      then the Early Secret is HKDF-Extract(0, 0).

   o  "hs_secret" contains the handshake key that was computed using
      (EC)DHE.
